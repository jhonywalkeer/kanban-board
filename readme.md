## üíª Repository Summary

This weekend I was studying about kanban and I saw that you have several tools with the kanban board (previously I had just created the Trello layout) so it came to my mind: "Why not, create a simple web application to use kanban ?"

## :bookmark_tabs: How to use

- Add a task and it will appear in the backlog stingray
- After adding, just drag and drop to other stingrays as you complete each step

## üõ† Technologies

#### Project was built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **VanillaJS** but what is it?

- **HTML** - Or HyperText Markup Language, which means: "Hypertext Markup Language" is a markup language used in the construction of the "skeleton" of web pages.

- **CSS** - Or Cascading Style Sheets is a mechanism for adding style to a web document.

- **VanillaJS** - Nothing else is pure JavaScript. The play on the name probably arose from the English expression ‚Äúvanilla (something)‚Äù, which refers to the most common or simplest version of something.

## üî® Local Installation

You will need [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) in the most up-to-date version installed on your computer to continue.

```bash
https://github.com/jhonywalkeer/kanban-board.git

$ cd kanban-board
$ code .
```

And now to run our game locally just open the `index.html` file and open it with the **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)** extension
